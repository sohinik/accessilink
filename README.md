# AccessiLink
AccessiLink is a tool for visually impaired people to better see all the links available on a given URL.

# About
This was inspired by my work with visually-impaired children through my research with the MIT Sinha Lab for Vision, which studies various neurological problems related to vision. I was able to learn about their incredible stuggles when it came to technology, which is not often built for accessibility. This inspired AccessiLink - a web app to help understand websites.

AccessiLink is a tool for visually impaired people to better see all the links available on a given URL. To use AccessiLink, head over to the "Try It" tab, input the URL you want, and hit submit! All the links available on the page will show up in an easy-to-see format.

# Running AccessiLink
To run AccessiLink, simply download the GitHub repo, and run the app.py file. Then, head over to localhost:5000 and try AccessiLink!

# How It's Made
We used Flask/Python for the backend, and HTML/CSS/Javascript for the frontend. It was our first time using Flask, so we had to learn it at a learning curve. We used Figma for the initial wireframes, as it is our go-to tool for designing a powerful UI. You can see our initial wireframes as an image on the "Process" tab on the website!

# Fair Opportunity Project Submission
We ran an analysis on the Fair Opportunity Project website for our submission, and found that several parts of the website are not AA-conformant. The biggest issue was that some links were found and ares with very low color contrast ratios. Our proposal for the site is to increas the color contrasts, and we are developing a Chrome Extension that can automatically find and correct this.

# Challenges
The biggest challenges was finding time and streamlining the workflow. It was one of our first hackathons, and for the other, the first itme creating this type of site, and most of the technologies were new to both of us. Additionally, conducting the initial researc into official accessibility guidelines, creating the color palette, and testing everything to make sure the site is AA-conformant was a big step we knew we had to take. However, we are proud of the site, and hope it comes in handy!
